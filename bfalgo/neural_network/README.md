A neural network classifier for MNIST data (images of hand-written digits).

We followed M. Nielsen's code structure, but using Tensorflow-like vector directions (each flattened image is a row vector here).  

How to use:
`python network.py`
You should observed an accuracy of ~94.7% on training data, ~94.1% on test data, after 10 epochs.
